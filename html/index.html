                <p>
                    Sustainable packaging is packaging that produces the most negligible impact on the natural
                    environment. Which is to say, sustainable packaging materials are those that make the least amount
                    of pollution in regards to manufacturing, production, shipping, and disposal or recycling.
                    This translates to increased utilization of life cycle inventories and the assessments of said life
                    cycles in an attempt to help guide the implementation of packaging materials which reduces the
                    negative impact to the environment and a reduced ecological footprint.

                <p>
                    The sustainability of a packaging material is defined by the impact that said material has on the
                    natural environment when compared to alternative materials. This can be complicated as various
                    packaging materials claim to be sustainable but are not
                    sustainable when compared to other types of packaging materials currently available

                <p>
                    It’s widely known that the world’s current disposal system has not been able to adapt to the growing
                    market’s dependance on plastic packaging, while failing to capture its economic benefits.
                    In fact, more than 40 years after the launch of the first universal recycling symbol, just 14% of
                    the plastic packaging used globally is recycled, while 40% ends up in landfills and 32% in
                    ecosystems, with the remaining 14% used for incineration or energy recovery (The SustainAbility
                    Institute).

                    The good news is that plastics are sustainable when they are circular. By applying the circular
                    economy and its three main principles – the 3R’s: reduce, reuse, and recycle –, it is possible to
                    save both environmental and financial resources in industrial plastic packaging worldwide. Here is
                    how.
